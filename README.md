## The unsolved problems which i would be fixed in future iterations:

the basic requirement i finish from them , but the Potential Extra Tic Tac Toe there some i didn't solve . 

* Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win, lose and tie counter
* Allow players to customize their tokens (X, O, name, picture, etc)
* Use localStorage to persist data locally to allow games to continue after page refresh or loss of internet connectivity
* Create an AI opponent: teach JavaScript to play an unbeatable game against you

* I make two loops to check the array
* If there is matching it will be winning otherwise the result will be tie
